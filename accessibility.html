                        Our initial idea for the website was that the best way to invoke the experience of being a first semester student at OsloMet would be to have the website resemble Canvas.
                        We decided that we would include some of the typical design principles of canvas, but alter them in a way that would make sense in the confines of the assignment.
                        We would start out by building a functioning site that implemented the basic Canvas layout.

                        We know that we wanted to select colors that would contrast nicely with the black font and the white background,
                        and that would be easily distinguishable from both for any user with color vision deficiency.
                        We also wanted to make sure that the color would be a pleasant and welcoming color.
                        #009FB7 fit the bill quite nicely.

                        The icons were also made from scratch to be ligible and self explanatory and as they are vectors, are made to be infinitely scalable.
                        We wanted the icons to share the design principles as those used on canvas, but to be easily distinguishable from those icons.

                        After a little bit of tweaking and they great. Small enough the have some breathing room,

                        The code has also been written with a clear focus on readability.
                        Each section is clearly separated with comments and variables are named in a way to make it easy for any coder to tell what they represent.
                        The layout, indents and flow of each page is also consistent and readable at a glance. 
                        Images are handled the same site-wide, with alt's and titles and sources where necessary.

                        When the site was finally up and running, looking good and containing content it was time to start running it through its paces.
                        We had, right from the start, decided to make this design clean. 
                        Focusing more on intelligability then we had in our previous assignments, so we didn't foresee many issues.

                        Wave-plugin threw up a handful of alerst, but only one error. Low contrast between a highlighted category and the font:
                    </p>
                    <figure class="accessibility-figures">

                    <p>
                        The plugin "Axe accessibility" also threw up contrast concerns as well as some icon-text errors.
                        We went on to fix the errors and increasing the contrast slightly to make it more readable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Running the site through W3C's HTML and CSS validators brings up a number of errors and warnings however. 
                        Mostly related to comments and stray end-tags. Nothing that isn't easily taken care of.
                        After having run the site through some readers we made our final fixes, so that the "reader" experience would be less confusing.
                        This boiled down to chainging some alt's and title's, as tabbing and navigating worked well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All in all the focus on clean, readable code, legible design and simple layout seem to have payed off in the end.
                        The site works without issue, validators report the code as clean and plugins report no glaring issues related to accessibility. 
                        Lastly we worked to make sure that the site works well on different resolutions. Scaling for smaller resolutions and adjusting some text-sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Very last note! We have added an event listener in the script file which changes the color scheme of the menu based on the screen size of different devices.
                        On the basis of that no one usually resize their web browser, again and again, many times a day to check the responsiveness, except us webdesigner of course,
                        the effect of the color change does not take effect untill you refresh the page. So when testing for responsiveness, remember to refresh the page to see the color change.
                        And the search-bar is just illustrative to what might come.
